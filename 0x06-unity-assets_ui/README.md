> # 0x06. Unity - Assets: UI

---
| **Filename** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| [0. Leveling up](./Assets/) | Create two more Scenes in `0x06-unity-assets_ui`. For each new scene, create a new path of platforms for the `Player` to navigate through.  |
| [1. Choose your own adventure](./Assets/) | The next few tasks will be creating UI elements using imported images to build a menu that allows the player to choose a level.  |
| [2. Option in](./Assets/) | new Scene called `Options`.  |
| [3. Pushing buttons](./Assets/) | new `C# script` called `MainMenu.cs`. In the `MainMenu` scene, script the level buttons scene so that choosing `Level01`, `Level02`, or `Level03` loads the corresponding scene.  |
| [4. Wait, hold on, time out](./Assets/) | the `Level01` Scene, create a new Canvas and using the image as a guide, create a pause screen with the following objects:  |
| [5. Es-ca-pÃ©](./Assets/) | new `C# script` called `PauseMenu.cs`. Add a method to this script so that when the player presses Esc while playing the game, the game should pause and the `PauseCanvas` should become active. The timer should also pause.  |
| [6. Even more button pushing](./Assets/) | the `PauseMenu` and `PauseMenu.cs`, script the `RestartButton` so that it reloads the level scene that the player is currently on.  |
| [7. Up is down, down is up](./Assets/) | the `CameraController.cs` script, add the ability to [invert the Y axis](https://www.giantbomb.com/inverted-controls/3015-5663/).  |
| [8. But Y?](./Assets/) | In `Options` and `OptionsMenu.cs`, script it so that checking the `InvertYToggle` in the menu and applying the changes reverses the camera/mouse movements in the level scene.  |
| [9. A winner is you](./Assets/) | the `Level01` Scene, create a new Canvas and using the image as a guide, create a win screen with the following objects  |
| [10. Winning isn't everything](./Assets/) | `WinTrigger.cs` so that when the player touches the flag, `WinCanvas` becomes active.  |
| [11. Still under development](./Assets/) | Create three `builds` of all scenes above in the `Builds` directory.  |
